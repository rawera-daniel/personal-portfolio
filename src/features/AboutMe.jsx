        Hello, Iâ€™m Rawera ðŸ‘‹, I've been very interested in tech since I was
        young, but I couldn't pursue my true passion in college. After a couple
        years, I decided to quit my job to teach myself coding full-time,
        focusing on in-depth JavaScript courses, especially React. Now that I
        have completed those and have a bunch of real-world projects under my
        belt. As a self-taught developer, the joy of writing code, testing it,
        and creating real-world projects keeps me motivated and dedicated to
        improving my skills.
