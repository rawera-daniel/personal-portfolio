        Hello, Iâ€™m Rawera ðŸ‘‹, a front-end developer specializing in JavaScript,
        particularly React, based in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. I'm a driven
        individual who enjoys planning, building, and utilizing my skills to
        turn code into a robust product. Attention to detail, problem-solving,
        and a love for learning from others are key parts of who I am. Outside
        of coding, you'll find me socializing with friends, engaging in
        conversations with open-minded individuals, or discovering new cafes.
